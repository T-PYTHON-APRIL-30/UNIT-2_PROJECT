        <p>I am a computer science graduate from Taif University with experience as a full-stack developer.
            My passion for technology and programming led me to pursue a degree in computer science, where I gained a
            solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a full-stack developer, I have experience working on both the front-end and back-end of web applications.
            I am skilled in designing and developing web applications from scratch using modern technologies such as
            ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB.
            I am a quick learner and enjoy working on challenging projects that allow me to expand my knowledge and
            skills.
            I am also a team player and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am excited about the future of technology and look forward to contributing to the field of computer
            science through my work.</p>
